Feature: StepDefinition Type

  \@grammar
  Step Definition is a grammar rule in SheepDog.xtext contained within a Step Object. These tests verify editing Step Definition elements within a document.

  @list
  Scenario: Step Definition

    \@list
    Step Definition must have
    - Name
    and optionally have these
    - Description
    - Step Parameters List

    Given The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file StepDefinitionList node is created as follows
          | Node Path          | Step Definition Name  |
          | StepDefinitionList | First Step Definition |
     When The xtext plugin edit document action is performed to modify StepDefinitionList with
          | Step Object Full Name                       | Node Path          | Step Definition Name   |
          | stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc | StepDefinitionList | Second Step Definition |
     Then The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file StepDefinitionList node will be created as follows
          | Node Path            | Step Definition Name   |
          | StepDefinitionList/2 | Second Step Definition |
      And The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file StepParameterList node will be as follows
          | Node Path                               | State |
          | StepDefinitionList/1/StepParameterList | Empty |
      And The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file Description node will be as follows
          | Node Path                        | State  |
          | StepDefinitionList/1/Description | Absent |

  Scenario: Duplicate Step Definition Name

    Step Definition name must be unique within a Step Object. Creating a Step Definition with an existing name returns the existing one.

    Given The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file StepDefinitionList node is created as follows
          | Node Path          | Step Definition Name  |
          | StepDefinitionList | First Step Definition |
     When The xtext plugin edit document action is performed to modify StepDefinitionList with
          | Step Object Full Name                       | Node Path          | Step Definition Name  |
          | stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc | StepDefinitionList | First Step Definition |
     Then The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file StepDefinitionList node will be as follows
          | Node Path            | State  |
          | StepDefinitionList/2 | Absent |

  Scenario: Sorted Step Definition Name

    Step Definitions are sorted alphabetically by name within a Step Object.

    Given The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file StepDefinitionList node is created as follows
          | Node Path          | Step Definition Name   |
          | StepDefinitionList | Second Step Definition |
     When The xtext plugin edit document action is performed to modify StepDefinitionList with
          | Step Object Full Name                       | Node Path          | Step Definition Name  |
          | stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc | StepDefinitionList | First Step Definition |
     Then The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file StepDefinitionList node will be created as follows
          | Node Path            | Step Definition Name   |
          | StepDefinitionList/1 | First Step Definition  |
          | StepDefinitionList/2 | Second Step Definition |
